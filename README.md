BrownFish CMS (Early Preview)
===

A simple, yet advanced PHP Content Management System built on top of the [Yii Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/).
Flexibility, efficiency and abstraction for further extensions are central in this application.
Pull requests for new (core) features and/or improvements are always welcome, features that don't belong in the core
should be created as plugin and submitted to the BrownFish Plugin database (coming soon).
